JavaScript codes are here...



To run Promt and Alert on the VS code: npm install promt-sync
Or, if it's not working then, copy the node_modules file from here and paste it on your folder.
then use this line before your code start in VScode: const prompt = require('prompt-sync')();
for alert: const alert = require('alert-sync')();
